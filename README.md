# eSign-Automation
This is an eSign product and the full meaning of this product is E-Signature. This project is a combination of eCipher & eKYC. eCipher is a Remote Signing Solution to digitally sign documents and contracts online, ensuring the authenticity, integrity, and non-repudiation of the signer and the security of the document. EKYC is a digital user onboarding system. Users are verified through the National ID database. I automated some modules of eCipher and the full verification system of eKYC(just like data fetch from email).
